title: "MPI Operator on GKE and GPUDirect RDMA"

---

Running distributed applications, such as those using the Message Passing Interface (MPI) or NVIDIA's Collective Communications Library (NCCL) for GPU communication, often requires each participating process (or Pod, in Kubernetes terms) to have access to high-speed, low-latency interconnects. Simply sharing a generic network interface among many high-performance jobs can lead to contention, unpredictable performance, and underutilization of expensive hardware.

The goal is resource compartmentalization: ensuring that each part of your distributed job gets dedicated access to the specific resources it needs – for instance, one GPU and one dedicated RDMA-capable NIC per worker.

## DRANET + MPI Operator: A Powerful Combination

- DRANET: Provides the mechanism to discover RDMA-capable NICs on your Kubernetes nodes and make them available for Pods to claim. Through DRA, Pods can request a specific NIC, and DRANET, via NRI hooks, will configure it within the Pod's namespace, [even naming it predictably (e.g., dranet0)](/docs/user/interface-configuration)

- [Kubeflow MPI Operator](https://github.com/kubeflow/mpi-operator): Simplifies the deployment and management of MPI-based applications on Kubernetes. It handles the setup of MPI ranks, hostfiles, and the execution of mpirun.

By using them together, we can create MPIJob definitions where each worker Pod explicitly claims a dedicated RDMA NIC managed by DRANET, alongside its GPU

### Example: Running NCCL Tests for Distributed Workload Validation

A common and reliable way to validate that that our distributed setup is performing optimally is by running an [NVIDIA's Collective Communications Library (NCCL) All-Reduce test](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nccl-tests). This benchmark is designed to exercise the high-speed interconnects between nodes, helping you confirm that the RDMA fabric (like InfiniBand or RoCE) is operating correctly and ready to support your distributed workloads with expected efficiency.

Let's see how we can run this with DRANET and the MPI Operator, focusing on a 1 GPU and 1 NIC per worker configuration.

#### Defining Resources for DRANET

First, we tell DRANET what kind of NICs we're interested in and how Pods can claim them.

**DeviceClass (dranet-rdma-for-mpi):** This selects RDMA-capable NICs managed by DRANET.

```yaml
apiVersion: resource.k8s.io/v1
kind: DeviceClass
metadata:
  name: dranet-rdma-for-mpi
spec:
  selectors:
    - cel:
        expression: device.driver == "dra.net"
    - cel:
        expression: device.attributes["dra.net"].rdma == true
```

**ResourceClaimTemplate (mpi-worker-rdma-nic-template):** MPI worker Pods will use this to request one RDMA NIC. DRANET will be instructed to name this interface dranet0 inside the Pod.

```yaml
apiVersion: resource.k8s.io/v1
kind: ResourceClaimTemplate
metadata:
  name: mpi-worker-rdma-nic-template
spec:
  spec:
    devices:
      requests:
        - name: rdma-nic-for-mpi
          exactly:
            deviceClassName: dranet-rdma-for-mpi
            selectors:
            - cel:
                expression: device.attributes["dra.net"].ifName == "gpu2rdma0"
    config:
    - opaque:
        driver: dra.net
        parameters:
          interface:
            name: "dranet0" # NCCL will use this interface
```

#### Install the GKE optimized RDMA dependencies

GKE automatically install on the VM some optimized RDMA and NCCL libraries for Google Cloud infrastructure, that can be installed following the instructions on:

https://cloud.google.com/ai-hypercomputer/docs/create/gke-ai-hypercompute-custom#install-rdma-configure-nccl

In order to use them you need to mount the following volumes

```yaml
spec:
  volumes:
    - name: library-dir-host
      hostPath:
        path: /home/kubernetes/bin/nvidia
    - name: gib
      hostPath:
        path: /home/kubernetes/bin/gib
```

in your workloads:

```yaml
containers:
  - name: my-container
    volumeMounts:
      - name: library-dir-host
        mountPath: /usr/local/nvidia
      - name: gib
        mountPath: /usr/local/gib
    env:
      - name: LD_LIBRARY_PATH
        value: /usr/local/nvidia/lib64
```

#### Crafting the MPIJob

The MPIJob specification is where we tie everything together. We'll define a job with two workers, each getting one GPU and one DRANET-managed RDMA NIC.

```yaml
apiVersion: kubeflow.org/v2beta1
kind: MPIJob
metadata:
  name: nccl-test-dranet-1gpu-1nic
spec:
  slotsPerWorker: 1 # 1 MPI rank per worker Pod
  mpiReplicaSpecs:
    Launcher:
      replicas: 1
      template:
        spec:

            name: mpi-launcher
            command: ["/bin/bash", "-c"]
            args:
            - |
              set -ex

                -map-by slot \
                -mca routed direct \
                -x LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/nvidia/lib64 \
                bash -c \
                  "source /usr/local/gib/scripts/set_nccl_env.sh; \

                    -g 1 -b 1K -e 8G -f 2 \
                    -w 5 -n 20;"
            securityContext:
              capabilities:
                add: ["IPC_LOCK"]

                nvidia.com/gpu: 1 # Each worker gets 1 GPU
            volumeMounts:
              - name: library-dir-host
                mountPath: /usr/local/nvidia
              - name: gib
                mountPath: /usr/local/gib
          volumes:
            - name: library-dir-host
              hostPath:

            - name: gib
              hostPath:
                path: /home/kubernetes/bin/gib
```

#### Running and Observing

Once deployed, the MPI Operator will launch the job. The launcher Pod will execute mpirun, which starts the all_reduce_perf test across the two worker Pods. Each worker Pod will use its dedicated GPU and its dedicated dranet0 (RDMA NIC) for NCCL communications.

You can monitor the launcher's logs to see the NCCL benchmark results, including the achieved bus bandwidth.

```sh
kubectl logs $(kubectl get pods | grep launcher | awk '{ print $1}') -f
+ mpirun --allow-run-as-root --prefix /opt/openmpi -np 2 -bind-to none -map-by slot -mca routed direct -x LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/nvidia/lib64 bash -c 'source /usr/local/gib/scripts/set_nccl_env.sh;     /usr/local/bin/all_reduce_perf       -g 1 -b 1K -e 8G -f 2       -w 5 -n 20;'
